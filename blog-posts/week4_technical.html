				<h1>Enumerables</h1>

				<p>First of all.  What in the world is an enumerable??  Enumerable is a class that is a group of methods that are useful when traversing, searching, and sorting through some data. There are many methods available within this class that allow this iteration such as sort_by (which I learned about at great length this week) and map, which I will go into further detail about.  These methods usually have two forms - one that has an object and a block and one that does not have a block, where an enumerator is returned.  These enumerable methods are all based off of the each method.
				<h2><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map" target="_blank">Enumerable#map</a></h2>
				<p>The map method is fun in that it allows you to do some action (block) on a group or collection of elements such as in an array.  Block is run once for each element in the group and an array is the output.  When no block is given an enumerator array is returned.  Map is useful because you can modify the group of elements and return it without changing the original one.  When using each you would have to iterate through each element, perform the action inside the each, and then return the result.  Map actually alters the elements as it iterates through them. Woohoo!</p>
				<p>Here are some examples</p>
				<pre>
original_array = [1,2,3,4]
original_array.map{|x| x*3} #=>   [3, 6, 9, 12]
original_array #=>   [1, 2, 3, 4]</pre>
				<p>The block in this example is "x*3 and the object is x".  Map iterates through each element in the original_array and performs the block on it.  For each element, the result of block is returned in the new array.  You can then see that the original array was not modified by returning it.  </p>
				<pre>
new_array = (1..5).map{"test"} #=> ["test", "test", "test", "test", "test"]</pre>
				<p>This example does not have a block so we set the number of times to iterate through the object (5 times).  The result is an enumerator with the object repeated 5 times.  In this case I set it to new_array, which can then be used later as a variable.</p>
