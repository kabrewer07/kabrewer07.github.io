				<h1>More Women!</h1>

				<p>I feel that one of the biggest issues with the tech world is the lack of women. I know that this is by no means on purpose, but this industry is seriously lacking in the female department. I have been in this industry for about 7 years now and everywhere I have worked there have been few to no girls I have encountered doing what I do. Just in NYC, men outnumber women in tech jobs 7 to 3.  Even in our DBC NYC class I think there are maybe 4 women.  That is a 5:1 ratio!!</p>
				<p>Although there is still somewhat of a glass ceiling in place for women in technoloy, the tech community has been making significant efforst to increase the number of women in the industry.  Groups such as Girls Who Code and Change the Ratio are taking an active role in changing this.  Even coding bootcamps are actively working on getting more women by offering scholarships.  The fact that there are programs available only to women to learn about tech-related fields is amazing.  The industry needs to keep on encouraging and educating women young and old about this field.  It is truly an amazing industry to get involved with.  Talk about job security!  There will ALWAYS be tech jobs.  I have never had a problem finding a job (knock on wood).</p>
				<p>This is always going to be a work in progress but I think this industry is headed in the right direction.  It is growing exponentially and I feel the number of women in it will see a steady increase with it! It does not take a genius computer gamer to make a great web developer.  I am only good at Dr. Mario.  Let's break down that glass ceiling!</p>
