				<p>According to the test we took, I have a Concrete Random thinking style.  Generally, this means I am an experimenter.  Ok, that is me for sure.  But when I went on to read more about my thinking style at <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm</a> I was amazed by how much this matches me - as much as I may hate to admit it. The one item that differs from me is "able to compete with others".  I strongly dislike competing unless it is some sort of board or card game.</p>
				<p>Some of these attributes have really contributed to my struggles so far in Phase 0.  I am so used to solving problems by myself so talking through challenges and solving problems in peer pairing has been a learning process for me.  I think I am getting the hang of it though!  It is rewarding to be able to help someone or to learn from them.  Another one that is sadly very much me is that it's hard for me to redo anything once it is done.  So refactoring is new for me.  I would usually just leave the code the way it is as long as it works.  Keeping detailed records and showing how I got an answer - this is a crucial part of phase 0 such as with the reflections, psuedocode, and refactoring.  I have never been good at this but am glad that I am being forced to do it.</p>
				<p>In order to work towards having a growth mindset I need to break outside of this Concrete (haha) Random box.  Although it says those are the best ways for me to learn - that is definitely not the mentality of DBC.  So I am learning some new ways to learn that hopefully I can learn to appreciate and enjoy.  I already appreciate having the reflections so that I know where I struggled and how I overcame challenges.  This is not something I would normally do and I can see the benefit. I also really need to work on having a routine at least with work so that I can succeed.  Also, it says I am best working independently and although this is how I have worked for a while now, this is not how DBC or any company really works and I am glad to learn how to work as a team.</p>
