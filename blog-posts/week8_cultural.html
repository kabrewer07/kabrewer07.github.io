				<h1>Conflict</h1>

				<p>When thinking about the times I have encountered emotional conflict, one time that really sticks out in my memory revolved around a company I worked at.  The company was great to work for on the surface, but I started to learn over the few years that I worked there that the executives really could care less about their employees.  They almost made us feel like we should just accept these low wages and not so great treatment and be grateful that they were employing us.  When we started to learn more about their odd human resource practices and a close friend of mine was fired I was extremely frustrated.  I ended up getting very upset and had a very long discussion with the President of the company about mine (and other employees) frustrations.</p>
				<p>The source of the conflict in my opinion was differing views on perception and personal values.  The higher up people in the company had different views from us on the way the company should be run, how wages should be handled, health insurance, and other areas that were important to us and not to them.  They did not think offering health insurance was a big deal. Also, they were willing to outsource a lot of work overseas to save money but it caused all sorts of problems with communication and quality work.  </p>
				<p>Ultimately I did not agree with the way they ran their company so I did have that conversation with them about my disagreements and stayed with them for a few more months.  Eventually I planned to move so I stopped working full time and only worked on a contract basis.  Having the distance from the office made my disagreements much easier to handle.  I still am not sure what a better way would have been to handle the situation.  I really don't think what I said to them changed anything with the way the company was run but it did make them reach out to the person they fired to try to help him out as he was in a tough place at the time.  </p>
				<p>If I could go back I probably would not have stayed as long as I did.  Everyone was teaming up behind the executives backs and it just really was a toxic, gossip-driven environment.  Not a good place to be all day every day!  I also would have spoken up for getting what I deserved.  I knew I was a great asset to their team and should have been compensated accordingly.</p>
