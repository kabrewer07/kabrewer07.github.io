				<h1>Pairing is Caring</h1>

				<h2>Peer Pairing</h2>
				<p>Pairing has been quite the learning experience for me!  I have been freelancing for a few years now so working through challenges with someone is new for me.  At first I was very wary of it.  However, pairing with other people has helped me not only technically but emotionally.  I feel like I have already made some friends!  Sometimes when I am very overwhelmed, it helps to know that other people are in the same boat.  I know people now that I can specifically ask for help. </p>
				<p>Although sometimes I feel like I understand more than the other person and am somewhat teaching them how to do something, it still can be beneficial.  Even as I am explaining something I have these "aha!" moments.  For example, although I knew JavaScript relatively well, it was still a learning experience for me explaining how to do certain logic. I have also found that I have been clueless on a challenge and my pair partner has significantly helped me.  Before this, I would have said I prefer to work alone.  However, pairing has shed a new light on working as a team!</p>
				<p>There will always be frustrations and difficulties when pairing.  Everyone is different.  From having trouble coordinating times to pair to computer technical difficulties, you just have to be flexible and know that it will all work out.  </p>
				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				<p>Upon reading my feedback, I felt very happy!! It seems that I have been very helpful in my pairing sessions when it is a topic I understand and also receptive to learning and hearing the other person's ideas.  I do know and can see in the feedback that sometimes I say things a little too quickly and jumble it up when I come up with an idea or am excited. I will work on slowing myself down and not jumping to conclusions too quickly.  Even though we are still very much in the beginning stage of learning, I could work on not relying on resources so much for code snippets.</p>
				<p>Writing feedback about others was fun.  It was nice to be able to be honest about the session while being specific, actionable, and kind.  I don't think I could say anything too negative about anyone I paired with anyways!  The most difficult thing when writing feedback was if I did have any criticism worrying that the person would know it was me.  But luckily there was not anything that I would have to be too worried about!  Everyone has been great!</p>
				<p>Overall I have felt that while pairing and giving feedback can be tedious and yes, sometimes things take longer pairing than they would have alone, it can also be very time saving as well and help me learn.  I think this is a good system to use for getting us started with pairing.
