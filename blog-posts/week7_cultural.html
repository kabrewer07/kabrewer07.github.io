				<h1>Values</h1>

				<p>When exploring my own values, at the times I have been the happiest and most satisfied in my life those values have been compassion, romance, friendships, helping other people, location, stability, volunteering, and accomplishment.  Yes, I know those are a lot of values but they are the most important to me.</p>
				<p>I feel like compassion is one of the most important values as showing compassion can not only make you feel happier and more satisfied, but will do the same for whoever or whatever you are showing compassion for.  Compassion is a value which encompasses so many others such as helping others, empathy, community, peace, and respect (to name a few).  Compassion is so very important in society today.  Having compassion motivates people to help others and promotes community and peace. </p>
				<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
					Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
					<ul>
							<li>compassion: 4</li>
							<li>romance: 4</li>
							<li>friendships: 3</li>
							<li>helping other people: 3</li>
							<li>location: 3</li>
							<li>stability: 4</li>
							<li>volunteering: 2</li>
							<li>accomplishment: 4</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was what medical specialty my fiance should go into.  He is trying to figure out which specialty makes the most sense for him to pursue.  He loves interacting with patients so internal medicine would be ideal but he also wants to do anesthesia so he is not sure which one to pursue. </p>
				<p>When I think about my values, I feel like I am not doing nearly enough!  I want to show more compassion and work on my friendships and romance and I really want to volunteer.  As far as accomplishment I have been at a standstill but am really working on this by attending DBC.  Location is important to me but I can't really control it at the moment.  We move wherever my fiance needs to go for school.  I love stability and have it with most of my relationships but not with my career or living situation so I hope to have this in the near future as well.</p>
				<p>I am not sure what relationship my values might have with stereotype threat except to remember how accomplished I am and be proud of myself.  I should also remember that I am very lucky in so many other aspects of my life so I should never think lesser of myself.  When I am feeling down at DBC I plan to lean on my family and friends for encouragement and definitely exercise and do yoga!</p>
