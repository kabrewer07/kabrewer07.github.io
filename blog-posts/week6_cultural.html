				<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

				<p>Stereotype threat refers to a phenomenon where performance is affected by stereotypes.  Claude Steele came up with this theory and conducted research on it.  Because people are worried about confirming a stereotype they can sometimes end up fulfilling the stereotype. </p>
				<p>Being a female in the technology industry I have definitely encountered stereotype threat.  People are often surprised by several things about me when I am interviewing or meeting with others in my industry.  Once when I started at a job the two other developers were men and they asked me what video games I play.  Well I don't really play video games!  But I said I like to play Dr. Mario! They laughed at me and were surprised I don't play Call of Duty or WOW.  I felt right then and there that they did not take me seriously and that I had to prove myself.  I was almost nervous about every task I was given and what they would think of my work.  I'm sure this affected my code but I ended up proving to them that I knew what I was doing. I can easily see why women are discouraged from entering this industry and working with all men who are stereotyped to be better than us at this kind of work.  It's intimidating!</p>
				<p>When someone is feeling a stereotype threat, although it is not always easy to consciously discern when one exists, they need to realize that they are just as smart/talented/skilled as the next person.  You always have a different skillset than that person and you will have things you are good at and not so good at.  Realize those things and use them to your advantage.  Me for example - yes I love to code but I am also REALLY good at being friendly and talking to people.  At one job my company let me speak directly to our clients to hash out what they wanted. So in a way, although I may not have been the best coder in the company but I didn't always have to keep my head down in my computer and got to do cool things like make friends with an executive at a company.  Use your skills to get ahead and do what you love!</p>
