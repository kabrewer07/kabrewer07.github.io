				<h1>Half of being a developer is knowing what to ask (or Google)!</h1>

				<p>I have been a developer for about 7 years now and I feel like asking questions and researching has been a HUGE part of my growth and success.  There are a few key pieces to asking questions, especially when they are specific and code-related.</p>
				<p>Whenever possible, include the code or errors!  This is SO important.  It will both help others to help solve your problem and it will provide help to many people in the future.  There are many issues I have run into that I did not have to ask for help on because I searched for the error and found many solutions.  Then you can just apply whatever solution makes the most sense because there are so many ways to solve every problem in development. </p>
				<p>Another important factor when asking a question is to be as specific as possible.  If you are using an API, mention it.  If you are using a certain version of jQuery, include that.  An example of this is that there are many versions of jQuery out there and there have been times I have run into issues or errors when implementing a plugin and it was all because of the version of jQuery I was using!  This will also help others respond to your question and for future searches.</p>
				<p>Although there are many important parts to asking a question, a few others are having a title that is specific and related to the question, being concise, and reviewing the question before posting it.  If there are mistakes in the question they may be less inclined to responding.  These factors will also help other developers understand your question and know quickly from the title if they have an answer.  </p>
				<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/103351965623251180077/posts/6YTYA6UsfjC" target="_blank">Here is an example</a> of a question I asked on our DBC page and although it may not be the best question in the world, I was specific and got a great response! It turns out many people were having this same issue.
