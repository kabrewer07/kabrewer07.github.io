			<h2><a href="http://www.purewow.com" target="_blank">PureWow</a></h2>
			<p>This page is listing all of the relevant posts and pages related to a specific category (recipes in this case).  It is conveying many links and posts in a visually pleasing way with the use of images.  The visual challenge in this case is that there is so much content on this page (ads, videos, sliders, post images and text, etc.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com" target="_blank">Style Me Pretty</a></h2>
			<p>This page is a single post page on Style Me Pretty.  The purpose of this page is to display the content of a specific post.  There are several visual challenges such as fitting in many pictures on one page as well as maintaining the global site elements such as ads, navigation, and links to other pages and categories. The single and multiple post pages can get very long.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.coolmaterial.com" target="_blank">Cool Material</a></h2>
			<p>This is the homepage which displays content in a visually pleasing way to drive the user to want to look through the site by using the tiled images and listing some of the popular articles.  The user can easily navigate around the site and search.  It is not very cluttered at all.  I don't really see any visual challenges outside of placing the ads, which can be distracting.</p>
