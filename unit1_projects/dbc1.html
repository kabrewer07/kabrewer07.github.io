	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<h2>My name is Kim Brewer</h2>
	<p><img src="images/me.jpg" id="me" /></p>
	<h3>A bit about me</h3>
	<p>I am from Arizona but have lived all over the world.  In the past two years I have lived in the <strong>UK, Grenada (Caribbean), Oakland, Redlands, Syracuse, and now NYC</strong>!<br/>  I am a huge foodie and love doing yoga as much as I can.  I can't wait to learn a ton and meet some great people at DBC! 
	<h4>My Skillz</h4>
	<p>I have a degree in Business Management from <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">U of A</a> but found my way into web development before I even graduated from college.  At a small web development company I discovered my intense passion for coding and problem solving.  I taught myself from the ground up everything from <em>HTML to PHP and MySQL</em>.  Over the years I have worked at some great companies and have gained many skills that I will be able to use for the rest of my life!
