				<h2><a href="http://www.purewow.com" target="_blank">PureWow</a></h2>
				<p>PureWow is one of my favorite websites because it is pretty, modern and simple and is full of wonderful pictures and cool fonts.  My eyes are drawn to the logo and menu when I first go to the homepage.  Unfortunately, when I stand back a bit my eyes are also drawn to the ad at the top.  The website is a resource for wedding planning as well as a compilation of posts about beautiful weddings all over the world.  There are also numerous resources available across the website for someone planning a wedding such as the little black book of vendors and diy projects.  The content of the website is fun, dreamy, romantic, and informative.  It is very easy to find what I am looking for from any page because the navigation is pretty straight forward.  Although browsing the site is relatively easy, it can get tedious to scroll through so much content when navigating to older posts.  When I have been on the site for a while I just want to stay on it and keep looking through posts, but maybe that is just me being a girl!  It does not sell anything but does help advertise for many companies as it is such a widely used bride resource.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.coolmaterial.com" target="_blank">Cool Material</a></h2>
				<p>Are you starting to see a trend with designs I like?  I know, I know, this is a manly site.  But it's just so awesome!! Cool Material have so many cool things on it and it is like the PureWow for men (even though it came first).  It has areas of the site such as technology, drinks, videos, and even fashion.  When I first visit the site, my eyes immediately focus on the tiled images on the homepage.  This is the case even when I step back.  This website is very simple, sleek, and modern.  The website is similar to PureWow in that it is just informational about anything and everything, but is geared more towards the male population.  The content is funny, practical, and fun.  It is easy to find what you are looking for because the design is so simple.  You can browse or you can go to a specific category or search from any page.  After being on the site for a while I am happy and want to keep browsing.  The website does have a shop section but I have not yet purchased anything from it.  I hope to in the future!  It's a great place to look when trying to come up with a gift for a guy. </p>
