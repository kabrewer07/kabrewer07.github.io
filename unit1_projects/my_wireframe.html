		<h1>Design Plan for my Website</h1>
	</header>
	<div id="main">
		<p>Since this index page will be primarily used as basically a table of contents for various pages and blog posts we have worked on, I decided I want to make it look more visually pleasing and fun by integrating pictures in an instagram-like way.  I plan to stagger the images and put content to the right and left of them.  This content will be separated out into lists of links since they will basically fit into categories.  As we create more pages and categories of pages over this course, I can expand horizontally or vertically with the sections.  I will make the sections a percentage width of their container and will set a max width on the container so the images do not get huge. </p>
		<p>I want to be consistent across all of my pages so I will be using the same fonts and colors as I have used for my blog pages and a similar structure. </p>
