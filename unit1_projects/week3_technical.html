				<h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is quickly becoming very popular in modern day web development.  It is dynamic and can do so many things and is a crucial piece of the user experience puzzle.  It is also an integral part of mobile developement. Mobile browsing is rapidly becoming a more important part of our everyday lives.  Can you think of a day where you have not used your phone to look at something on the internet be it Facebook, Twitter, or the web?  All of these use Javascript for a variety of purposes.  JavaScript is now not only used for client-side code but is also becoming important on the server-side using node.js.  It also is used for game development and mobile and desktop applications.  From manipulating DOM elements to making database calls with AJAX, JS is an amazing and evolving language.
				<h2>Some cool JS features</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>You can test it quickly and see the source code</li>
					<li>Manipulate page elements</li>
					<li>Page events (such as onClick)</li>
					<li>jQuery (I LOVE THIS ONE)</li>
					<li>AJAX (say you want to add something to a database without leaving the page - so cool)</li>
					<li>It is the only standards based language in web browsers.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Limitations?</h2>
				<p>I haven't found anything wrong with JavaScript in the time I have spent using it or through research.  However,I look forward to maybe discovering some of it's limitations and how to work around them through DBC.</p>
