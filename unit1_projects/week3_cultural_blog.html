				<p>I think the Dev Bootcamp experience is going to being extremely intense and challenging yet it will be an amazing learning experience where I will build a new career path and make some lifelong friends.  The experience will really be what each and every student makes of it.  If you put in a huge amount of effort and try your best, you will get great results and it will be so worth it.  I also think that this career path will not be handed to us on a silver platter.  <em>This will not be easy.</em></p>
				<p>I think that this type of culture will be very new for me but I hope to thrive in it.  Since I am currently a freelance developer, I do not get to work with others very often or ask for help (or give it).  I am really excited to be able to learn how to work this way again and to be in the same situation as all of my fellow cohort peeps.  <em>We are all in this together!</em></p>
				<p>I am actually feeling more relaxed about this experience.  Listening to Shereef talk about the different fears we may have (yep, I have both) made me realize "wow" it is not just me that is freaked out.  Hearing that this will really be what we make of it and not something that we can just buy or order at a restaurant made me really stop and think.  I can make this something great!  Yes, I am very nervous about sooo many things - the work load, the long hours, working so closely with so many different people - but they will all be really good for me.</p>
